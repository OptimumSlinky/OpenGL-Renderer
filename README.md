# OpenGL-Renderer

My classes on Direct3D 11 were brutally fast, so in an effort to build mastery of modern rendering and graphics pipelines, I decided to change things up a bit and work through Joey de Vries' Learn OpenGL book (https://learnopengl.com/). I'm also using Cem Yuksel's awesome lectures (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLplnkTzzqsZS3R5DjmCQsqupu43oS9CFN) as supporting materials for this project.
